Description: `SMARTR` (Simple multi-ensemble atlas registration and statistical testing in R)
    This package allows for the user-friendly accomplishing of the analysis steps below:
    1. Setting up the pipeline by specifying experiment parameters, and save directories.
    2. The interactive registration process.
    3. Importing raw segmentation data from .txt files generated from ImageJ for multiple channels.
    4. Optionally creating a filter for the 'cfos' and 'eyfp' channels to clean segmented counts. 
    5. Creating a segmentation object that is compatible with `wholebrain` functions.
    6. Forward warping and mapping the data onto the standardized mouse atlas.
    7. Cleaning the mapped data in all the following ways: 
        + Removing cells that map outside the boundaries of the atlas.
        + Omitting regions by a default list of regions to omit.
        + Omitting regions by user specified region acronyms.
        + Removing Layer 1 cells
        + Removing cells from a contralateral hemisphere per slice if the registrations are divided by right and left hemispheres. 
    8.  Obtaining cell counts normalized by region volume (per mm^2^) and region areas (per mm^2^). 
    9. Aggregating counts into an experiment object.
    10. Performing a suite of analysis and visualization capabilities on experiment objects and automatically saving them to a standardized figure folder.
