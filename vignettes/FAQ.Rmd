# FAQ

Below is an FAQ 




## Hardware recommendations

+ Windows 10
+ RAM Requirements: we recommend a minimum of 32 GB of RAM because the image processing scripts can be intensive
+ Processor 
+ GPU - unnecessary but may be helpful


## What are some common errors I might encounter?


### How long should segmentation take?

It depends on the specs of your computer and the size and specs of your images. Since our images are somewhat high resolution, and our image [segmentation macro](https://osf.io/bek56) segments in 3D not 2D, it can be relatively computationally intensive. However, it is easy to process an equivalent dataset of ~150 images over a weekend using a computer with the recommended hardware specs.

### Not choosing the right brain.threshold

### out of bounds error


The `MAX_name.tif` file highlighted in blue is used as the reference image during interactive registrations. This is the a flattened version of the .`tif` file from step B. The `wholebrain` package can only do registrations on 2D tiff images so this `MAX_name.tif` is used to calculate the approximate transformation that should happen to all the cells segmented in 3D. Importantly, the brain contours in this `MAX_name.tif` cannot touch any of the 4 borders of an image. These images should either be manually edited in ImageJ to omit brain contours intersecting the image border, or the original `.tif` image (B) should be padded with a small border of black pixels.
