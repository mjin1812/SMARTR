# Scripting

A little bit of scripting can go quite a long way in scaling up this pipeline. In this section, we'll walk through some standard scripts for batch object creation and looping through registration correction for each mouse. Once all the registrations in a mouse are finished, we also have scripts that perform batch segmentation importation, cleaning of regions to omit, and mapping. For this section, we recommend spending a little time learning R syntax to better understand and even modify these scripts for your own use. [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/) is an excellent interactive resource to check out.


## Batch object creation

Although the organization of data into objects ensure a logical and heirarchical data management structure in SMARTTR, it can be super tedious to manually create each mouse and slice object and store each slice object into the appropriate mouse object. Here we provide a script that essentially performs this process automatically after reading in an excel file where users can more easily enter and edit metadata for mouse and slice object. Download the template [here](https://osf.io/zdm5w)!

When you open the template, you will see the left side (green colored columns) includes columns to populate the mouse metadata.

The right side (blue colored columns) includes columns where slice metadata is populated. Each row in the sheet will be read and used to create a new slice object.

</figure>

Paste over the example entries with your own mouse and slice parameters. 

For the slice metadata, the registration path column includes a formula to auto create a path to the max projection image from the pre-processing steps. You can drag this formula down to autopopulate the column. If you have a separate process and naming structure to create a flattened image, you can override this formula. Additionally, the left_regions_excluded and right_regions_excluded columns allow for entry of a default custom list of regions to exclude from each hemisphere. If left empty, the default list is used. If you are going to append your own acronyms, please make sure there are no spelling mistakes!

Once you're done entering into the spread sheet, either [download](https://osf.io/fkgw8) or copy and paste the script below into R.

## Registration correction looping notebooks

To improve the experience of registrations, we provide an interactive notebook for looping through each image. This automatically streamlines the process of finding an accurate brain contour for each image, and will auto-loop to the next image to register within each mouse. Instructions for each code chunk are included in the notebook.

## Batch segmentation importation and mapping

To automate the process of atlas mapping across many mice, we provide a demo batch script that allows for batch segmentation importation, mapping, region exclusion, and concatenation of datasets across all slices for each mouse. Before running this code, make sure all registrations are complete within all mice. Additionally make sure all segmentation macros in ImageJ have been run on all images so that segmentation output is available for importation into SMARTTR.
