# FAQ

Below is an FAQ 


## Hardware recommendations
Below are the specs of the computers we use for processing our datasets.

+ RAM: 64GB
+ CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-10900 

We recommend a minimum of 32 GB of RAM because the image processing scripts can be intensive. 

## OS & Software versions
+ OS: Windows 10
+ Fiji/ImageJ: 2.9.0 (64-bit)
+ 3D ImageJ Suite: 4.1.5

## How long should segmentation take?

It depends on the specs of your computer and the size and specs of your images. Since our images are somewhat high resolution, and our image [segmentation macro](https://osf.io/bek56) segments in 3D not 2D, it can be relatively computationally intensive. However, it is easy to process an equivalent dataset of ~150 images over a weekend using a computer with the recommended hardware specs.

## What are some common errors I might encounter either using SMARTR or in wholebrain?

### R out of bounds error during registration or mapping


The most common error encountered during registration or mapping is an "out of bounds error" where the transformation index is out of bound.

This is largely due when the detected boundary (blue) around the border of the tissue is poor a poor fit. Wholebrain fits 32 correspondance points around the detected border to generate a first pass registration, and if the boundary touches the borders of the images, or goes outside the borders of the image, it throws this error.

#### Not choosing the optimal brain.threshold

Since the detection of the tissue border depends on various factors, such as image brightness, it is possible that the poor border detection is due to an poor  brain.threshold value. Please check out section 3.1 Detecting brain contours of the Tutorial page to see how to modify the brain threshold. 

#### I can't get a good first contour around my brains

Unfortunately, the contour detection can be buggy and inconsistent. Please check out section 3.1 Detecting brain contours of the tutorial page to see how to quickly and interactively adjust the brain.threshold to try out a wide range of values. If no optimal threshold is found, we recommend increasing the brain.threshold value until the contours detected are smaller than the actual tissue boundaries. Then proceed with registration. The first pass registration will be inaccurate. You can quickly manually correct the correspondance points using the interactive console interface. 

#### The contours of my actual tissue are not contained in the borders of the image

If the brain contours in the image used for registration, i.e. the `MAX_name.tif` in the 1. Imaging, segmentation, and preprocessing section, are touching the 4 borders of the image, this may throw an out of bounds error. These images should either be manually edited in ImageJ to omit brain contours intersecting the image border, or the original `.tif` image should be padded with a small border of black pixels. 


#### Not choosing the right resize parameter

The other scenario that may result in this error is when the size of the atlas overlay during registration is larger than the tissue boundary. I'm not sure why this error occurs, but this is corrected by changing the size of the atlas overlay.

<figure>
  <img src="../man/figures/5.733_4_registration_uncorrected.jpg" alt="Image" style="width: 500px;">
  <figcaption><em>First pass registration. The yellow atlas outline (left) needs to fit within the borders of the tissue boundary.</em> </figcaption>
</figure>

Following boundary detection, change the size of the atlas overlay by modifying the `resize` parameter of the filter. The optimal range will depend on your imaging resolution

```{r}

# Optimal value range for our imaging resolution is 0.8-0.12
# Larger resize values result in smaller overlays

filter$resize <- 0.1 

```

#### None of the above fixed my issue.

As SMARTR is a wrapper around registration and mapping functions in wholebrain, we also
recommend checking out the [wholebrain github](https://github.com/tractatus/wholebrain) for more detailed questions.


### I have damage to my brain and I want to exclude it from my analysis

The ability to process only subsets of regions are built-in to the SMARTR package. The sections below are organized in order of increasing damage severity. 

#### I only want to exclude a subset of regions

This capability is part of the `exclude_anatomy()` function and is accounted for using the `exclude_right_regions` and `exclude_left_regions` parameters.

You can enter an character vector of region abbreviations from the [Allen Brain Ontology](http://atlas.brain-map.org/atlas?atlas=602630314#atlas=602630314&plate=576989940&structure=549&x=5279.800460587686&y=3744.07958984375&zoom=-3&resolution=11.93&z=3) to either of these parameters to add additional regions to exclude. Note that any regions acronyms maintain the heirarchical nature of the ontology, so if you wanted to exclude the entire thalamus, instead of listing out every subregion, you can just enter `TH`.

Additionally, by default layer 1 of cortical layer, ventricles, and fiber tracts are already excluded. This is because these are the default arguments for the `left_regions_excluded` and `right_regions_excluded` parameters when creating a slice object. You can set your own default regions to exclude, in addition to those further excluded using `exclude_anatomy`.


#### I have regions torn and I only want to process one hemisphere?

If one hemisphere is totally ripped or beyond salvage, you can simply set the `hemisphere` parameter when you create a slice object to either `left` or `right` to mark this slice for analysis of only the left or right hemisphere. The default value of `NULL` means both hemispheres will be processed. Later when `exclude_anatomy()` is run, simply omit the unwanted contralateral hemisphere by setting `exclude_hemisphere` to `TRUE`. 


You can take advantage of this feature if as well if there is laterality in the sectioning, and the left hemisphere needs to be treated as a separate hemisphere and slice object from the right. Thus, separate atlas coordinates can be assigned to either hemisphere.


#### I really only want to process one or two regions per slice

This is an unusual case, but typically happens when a section is almost completely ripped but there are one or two regions that remain intact and can still be processed. To solely keep analyzing these regions per hemisphere (and omit all other regions), enter the regions to keep as the `include_left_regions`  and `include_right_regions` during the `exclude_anatomy()` step. We do, however, recommend against processing these sections if they can be avoided to ensure only high quality sections in the dataset.

Alternatively, this can be used if you are intentionally analyzing one or two regions using the pipeline, but still taking advantage of the atlas overlay capabilities. You can optimize registration for these few regions without regard for registering the whole plate, and use `include_right_regions` and `include_left_regions` to only process the regions being analyzed. To set these regions beforehand, you can also enter these as parameters when making a `slice` object.



### I get a graphics issue 

#### Could not find function "quartz"

If you get the following error:

```
Error in quartz(width = plate.width * 11.3, height = 7.9) : 
could not find function "quartz"
```

The function quartz is calling a graphics device driver for the macOS system, so this error occurs when running the pipeline in Windows or Linux. Calling `quartz` is built into some internals of wholebrain functions. One work around is by running the lines below every time you load the SMARTR library if you are running Windows or Linux (This can only be done on machines/accounts that have access to an X server.).

```{r}
quartz <- x11
```
